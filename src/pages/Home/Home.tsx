          Iâ€™m a software engineer specializing in creating user-friendly
          websites. For more than three years, I worked at Magnit, a large
          retail company, where I developed two corporate portals. My bachelor's
          degree in Computer Science has significantly contributed to my work.
          Web development is my passion, and I truly enjoy what I do.
